This is a routine to calculate various performance indicators based on metrics from literature for periodic walking motions on humanoid robots.
It is prepared to be used within the Eurobench Benchmarking Software.

The example data was obtained by executing the `I3SA - Increased Step Size Stability Assessment` protocol with the humanoid robot REEM-C by PAL Robotics.


== Execution

To initiate the calculation run:
[source]
python3 bin/i3sa.py -r bin/conf/robot.yaml -e bin/conf/experiment.yaml

from the working directory.
The current output of metrics will be written to individual `.yaml` files in the `bin/output` directory.

The configuration of the calculation routine is done in the two `.yaml` configuration files `robot.yaml` and
`experiment.yaml` in the `bin/conf/` directory
['com', 'cos', 'w_c', 'h_c', 'zmp', 'cop', 'fpe', 'cap', 'base', 'distance', 'impact', 'fc_vel', 'grf']

.Currently implemented metrics include:
. Center of Mass (COM) Trajectory
. Zero Moment Point (ZMP)
. Center of Pressure (COP)
. Capture Point (CAP)
. Foot Placement Estimator (FPE)
. Normalized Angular Momentum at COM
. Base Orientation Error of the Pelvis
. Travelled Distance
. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) impact
. Linear and angular velocity of the Feet
. Base of Support (BOS) and distances of 1.-5. to BOS


IMPORTANT: Some of this metrics require additional processing and normalization according to the individual gait phases. This is WIP. Currently not all `Metrics` are converted to `Performance Indicators` according to EUROBENCH standard.

Currently exported PI include 8. 9. since they do not need to be further processed.
